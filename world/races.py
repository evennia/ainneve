Races module.

This module contains data and functions relating to Races and Focuses. Its
public module functions are to be used primarily during the character
creation process.

Classes:

    `Race`: base class for all races
    `Human`: human race class
    `Elf`: elf race class
    `Dwarf`: dwarf race class
    `Focus`: class representing a character's focus; a set of bonuses

Module Functions:

    - `load_race(str)`:

        loads an instance of the named Race class

    - `load_focus(str)`:

        loads an instance of the named Focus class

    - `apply_race(char, race, focus)`:

        have a character "become" a member of the specified race with
        the specified focus
