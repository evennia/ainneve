 You stand in the middle of an ancient |wbridge|n spanning the |gKai River|n.

 The |wriver|n runs from the north to the south, and a well-traveled |wroad|n
 runs east and west.

#
# add a description for the bridge
#
@detail bridge =

 The heavy timbers of the bridge appear sturdy enough to allow a merchant's
 cart to cross. The wood is carved ornately and is covered in undulating
 patterns of texture.

#
# add river detail
#
@detail river =

 Looking north, you see the river as it winds its way through the town
 of Riverport. A small island dotted with trees appears to your left
 not far away, and beyond it, a second bridge in the northern section of
 the city.

 Looking south, the |gKai|n heads toward its destination, the placid
 |gAiiro Lake|n.

#
# add road detail
#
@detail road =

 To the |weast|n, the town's main road stretches out before you, leading
 past the river's edge and through a clearing in the trees that stand
 restfully along the banks of the Kai.

 To the |wwest|n in the distance, you can see |gZodiac Square|n, the
 commercial center of Riverport.

 The road stretches on to the east and west. Surrounded by green meadows
 on either side, the paving stones of this stretch of road are worn, but
 well-maintained. In the distance, you hear the sound of burbling water
 coming from the |gRiver Kai|n.

 To the north, a grassy meadow extends along the banks of the |rKai|n.

 A massive broad-leafed tree stands in the middle of a carpet of green grass.
 A light breeze wafts through its branches, and you hear the gentle rustling
 of leaves from above.

 The steady presence of this tree fills you with a sense of serenity despite
 a dark and shady-looking grove of trees to the northwest.

#

 The tree's huge trunk is far too big for a normal-sized human to reach their
 arms around. It is by far the tallest structure in central Riverport.
