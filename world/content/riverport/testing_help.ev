 |wWelcome to |mAinneve|w!|n

 This is a pre-alpha, live instance of the example game for Evennia. It is very much
 a work in progress, and we need your help with testing the new |rcombat system|n.
 (see '|whelp combat|n' for more)

 If you find there is no one around to fight against, you can search the meadow to
 find our buddy, |cOl' Skurvy|n, to beat up on.

 If you have any feedback to give, please comment on the Combat Pull Request, which
 can be found at https://github.com/evennia/ainneve/pull/86

@sethelp/replace Combat =

 Combat in Ainneve is initiated with the |wattack|n command, and is turn-based.
 The duration of a combat action may be free (zero duration), half-turn, or
 full-turn.

 At the start of each turn, all combatants declare their actions. If a full-turn
 action is entered after a half-turn, the action is completed over the course of
 the two turns.

 |cStatus|n
 The |wlook|n command in combat gives you detailed information about the combat
 situation. Use it to determine your |Grange|n from opponents, what |Yactions|n
 you have entered, and how long before the |yturn timer|n ends.

 |cRange|n
 Range is the distance between characters in combat. In Ainneve, there are three
 possible ranges. The farthest being |Granged|n, moving closer brings a character
 to |Greach|n range, and for close combat, |Gmelee|n range. See the help for the
 '|wadvance|n' and '|wretreat|n' commands for more about range.

 All weapons are effective at one or more ranges. Melee weapons tend to be the
 strongest but only allow attack from melee range. Reach weapons can be used
 at either melee or reach range, and Ranged weapons can attack enemies at
 reach or ranged range.

 Be sure to |wequip|n your weapons and armor before entering combat. You can still
 equip them during the battle, but it is a half-turn action. Best to come prepared.

 |cAttacking|n
 The '|wattack|n' command is only available when a weapon is equipped. If you are
 unarmed, only the unarmed attacks '|wkick|n' and '|wstrike|n' are available.
 Both of these are melee attacks.
