"""
Skills module.

This module contains data and functions related to character Skills.
Skills in OA are treated as a modifier to a standard roll that is
typically compared to a target number of 5, though that can vary for
some skills.

Its public module functions are to be used primarily during the character
creation process.

Classes:

    `Skill`: convenience object for skill display data

Module Functions:

    - `apply_skills(char)`

        Initializes a character's db.skills attribute to support skill
        traits. In OA, all skills start matching their base trait before
        the player allocates a number of +1 and -1 counters.

    - `load_skill(skill)`

        Loads an instance of the Skill class by name for display of
        skill name and description.

    - `validate_skills(char)`

        Validates a player's skill penalty and bonus token allocations.
        Because the requirements depend on the char's INT trait, it
        accepts the entire char as its argument.

    - `finalize_skills(skills)`

        Finalizes and "saves" the player's allocations and deletes the
        'plus' and 'minus' extra keys used during chargen.
