"""
Chargen commands.

Ainneve implements MULTISESSION_MODE = 2, in which players enter an
OOC state immediately after creation. From that state, the @charcreate
command is available to create a new character. This command launches
the Ainneve character creation EvMenu.

This new @charcreate command is added to the session cmdset. We also
create a cmdset with the "Remove" mergetype to remove the original
version from the player cmdset.

To ensure that players cannot puppet a character until it has completed
the entire character creation process, we also override the default @ic
command on the player.
