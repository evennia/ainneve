        This method is called by the `cmdhandler` once the command name
        has been identified. It creates a new set of member variables
        that can be later accessed from `self.func()` (see below).

        The following variables are available to us:
           # class variables:

           self.key - the name of this command ('mycommand')
           self.aliases - the aliases of this cmd ('mycmd','myc')
           self.locks - lock string for this command ("cmd:all()")
           self.help_category - overall category of command ("General")

           # added at run-time by `cmdhandler`:

           self.caller - the object calling this command
           self.cmdstring - the actual command name used to call this
                            (this allows you to know which alias was used,
                             for example)
           self.args - the raw input; everything following `self.cmdstring`.
           self.cmdset - the `cmdset` from which this command was picked. Not
                         often used (useful for commands like `help` or to
                         list all available commands etc).
           self.obj - the object on which this command was defined. It is often
                         the same as `self.caller`.

    This sets up the basis for Evennia's 'MUX-like' command style.
    The idea is that most other Mux-related commands should
    just inherit from this and don't have to implement parsing of
    their own unless they do something particularly advanced.

    A MUXCommand command understands the following possible syntax:

        name[ with several words][/switch[/switch..]] arg1[,arg2,...] [[=|,] arg[,..]]

    The `name[ with several words]` part is already dealt with by the
    `cmdhandler` at this point, and stored in `self.cmdname`. The rest is stored
    in `self.args`.

    The MuxCommand parser breaks `self.args` into its constituents and stores them
    in the following variables:
        self.switches = optional list of /switches (without the /).
        self.raw = This is the raw argument input, including switches.
        self.args = This is re-defined to be everything *except* the switches.
        self.lhs = Everything to the left of `=` (lhs:'left-hand side'). If
                     no `=` is found, this is identical to `self.args`.
        self.rhs: Everything to the right of `=` (rhs:'right-hand side').
                    If no `=` is found, this is `None`.
        self.lhslist - `self.lhs` split into a list by comma.
        self.rhslist - list of `self.rhs` split into a list by comma.
        self.arglist = list of space-separated args (including `=` if it exists).

    All args and list members are stripped of excess whitespace around the
    strings, but case is preserved.
