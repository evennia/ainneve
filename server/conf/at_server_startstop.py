Server startstop hooks

This module contains functions called by Evennia at various
points during its startup, reload and shutdown sequence. It
allows for customizing the server operation as desired.

This module must contain at least these global functions:

at_server_init()
at_server_start()
at_server_stop()
at_server_reload_start()
at_server_reload_stop()
at_server_cold_start()
at_server_cold_stop()
